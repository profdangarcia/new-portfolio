This is my portfolio website repository. It's open source—feel free to grab some ideas.

## 🏃‍♂️ Run locally

Three simple steps:

1. This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Node.js 20+ is recommended. Install pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
# or
corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
